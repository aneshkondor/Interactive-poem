                Under <span class="highlight" data-detail="Sangeetha and her husband left their homeland, driven by shared dreams of a better future in America.">homeland skies</span>, dreams awoke,<br>
                Bound by home, with emotions untold.<br>
                <span class="highlight" data-detail="Together, they embraced a new chapter, leaving family and familiarity behind.">“A final embrace, love burning bright,</span><br>
                A step into darkness, chasing light.”
            </p>
            <p>
                In America’s tech world, she began her quest,<br>
                Balancing work and studies, she gave her best.<br>
                <span class="highlight" data-detail="Though skilled in technology, she longed to follow her true passion: business and leadership.">“Yet something stirred, deep within,</span><br>
                A calling to rise, and begin again.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight" data-detail="She envisioned a school where her children and others could learn in a system she believed in.">“A dream for her family,”</span> a future in sight,<br>
                A school she built, with love as her light.<br>
                Through every challenge, she paved her own way,<br>
                <span class="highlight" data-detail="Her school became a beacon of hope, empowering young minds to follow their passion.">“Building a legacy that shines each day.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now she reflects, with wisdom and grace,<br>
                A life well-lived, a meaningful space.<br>
                Her message clear, her voice profound:<br>
                <span class="highlight" data-detail="Sangeetha's life shows that challenges hold lessons and hope for growth and resilience.">“In every challenge, hope is found.”</span>
